## 🎟 Moving Pictures
- **#**
- [500 Days of Summer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1022603/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_25). This is a wonderful rom com.
- [8 Mile](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298203/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). This is a much better movie than commonly thought. I admit that it is not great cinema. The movie is also not the junk that some pretend it is.

- **A**
- [About Schmidt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257360/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Better than I expected.
- [A Haunting in Venice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22687790/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_i_1_pd_tp1_pbr_ic). For me the weakest of the new Poirot trillogy. That said, I do like the link of Venice to the horror/suspense theme, since before the city was branded as the city of love it always had a dark undertone and was associated with dark magic, intrigues and scary deaths. 
- [The Amazing Maurice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10473036/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1). I love the book so the movie has a bit of a disadvantage. Still a nice story, confidently told. Would have loved if it had a bit higher production values (especially in terms of lighting).
- [Anna](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7456310/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_4). Very similar to Atomic Blonde, but not so fresh. Still good.
- [The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443680/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_t_29_pd_tp1_pbr_ic). I love the aesthetics, but the plot and the pacing not so much. Needs to be watched with patience.
- [Army of Thieves](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13024674/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Beautiful visuals, mediocre movie, annoying franchise tie-ins and extremely bad ending.
- ⭐️ [A Series of Unfortunate Events (Netflix Series)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4834206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2). This is a visual stunning series with a magical plot, but no magic in it. Maybe not for everyone but I've been blown away.
- [Asteroid City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230388/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3_tt_6_nm_2_q_wes%2520anderson). For me this is great movie about creativity, invention, and movie making. It is not as good as *The French Dispatch* --- which is similar in many ways and I love --- or as inspiring as *Paterson* --- which is a very different movie about creativity that I love. So, not the best of its kind, but still very worthwhile. 
- [A Rainy Day in New York](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7139936/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_2). Surprisingly good movie for people who like Woody Allen movies.  I do not like the setting too much.
- [Atomic Blonde](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2406566/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_16). A good movie if one is in the mood for action. I like the style, the fights and the setting.
- [Ava](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8784956/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Yeah, I don't know. The movie is not necessary bad, but its not good either. I guess the best part are fight-choreographies.
- [Avengers: Endgame ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=ea4e08e1-c8a3-47b5-ac3a-75026647c16e&pf_rd_r=A32WGR8KNK73YPCB64F9&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=15506&pf_rd_i=moviemeter&ref_=chtmvm_tt_36). Please just stop.

- **B**
- [Bable](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449467/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_22_pd_tp1_cp). Good movie. Difficult to think now that blockbusters at a time had this quality.
- [Baby Driver](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). This is a great, great car-chase movie. The heist aspect is also nice, but you want to watch this movie because of the chase scenes.
- [Back to the Future ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/?ref_=nm_knf_i1). Classic. Very enjoyable movie.
- [Beach Bum](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6511932/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Nothing for me. Felt annoying from minute one on, so that I eventually needed to stop watching.
- [The Bear, S1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/episodes/?ref_=tt_eps_sm). One of the finest tv series I have ever seen. If you are not put of by the cooking/restaurant theme a must watch. Truly incredible.
- [The Bear, S2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/episodes/?season=2). A master piece. I would say that the overall plot is constructed worse than then the one for S1, but some of individual episodes are even better. Definitely a highlight. 
- [Between Two Ferns: The Movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9398640/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_5). I did like the old series on youtube. I do not like the flick.
- ⭐️ [Big Fish](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_14). <3 <3 <3 One of my favorite movies <3 <3 <3
- [Bill & Ted Face the Music](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1086064/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). It is what it is. And that is fine. If you like Bill & Ted (like me) you will like this movie, if you don't like em or don't know em its nothing for you.
- [Black Swan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947798/?ref_=ttls_li_tt). Incredibly movie about ballet, which is, of course, good because it is not about ballet. 
- [Blue Jasmine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334873/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_8). This would be a great movie if the ending would be a little bit better. The way it is, however, it is just a good one.
- [Bullet Train](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1). Funny assassin movie with lots and lots of action. Popcorn flick. Entertaining *tarantinoesque* spectacle. Quite funny and over the top. Maybe a bit too involved at times. Would recommend.
- [Burn After Reading](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887883/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_t_1_pd_tp1_pbr_ic). Just great entertainment.



- **C**
- - [Café Society](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513674/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_5). This movie is also a mixed bag for me. I enjoy the premise, the style and the humor, but I did not enjoy it that much. Maybe its to rushed?
- [Cloak & Dagger](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5614844/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). At its best the series is mediocre, at its worst it is bad.
- [Confessions of a Dangerous Mind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0270288/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_confessions%2520of%2520a%2520dange). Good movie about a show host who is also a C.I.A. agent. Kind off a slow burnder. Dreamy, at times surrealistic, always stylish. Needs commitment.
- [Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2). One of the best Kung Fu movies ever made.   

- **D**
- [Dark Web: Cicada 3301](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110246/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Almost complete trash. I just watched it because I was curious about how they realized the hacker-theme after watching Who am I.
- [Dead Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). A good movie. Just not my pair of shoes.
- [Death on the Nile](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7657566/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). A mediocre movie with amazing cinematography.
- [Death Race](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452608/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Mad Max for people who unironically like "The Fast and the Furios XYZ".  

- **E**
- [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1). Good, weird, and unconventional movie. Maybe not as good as everyone says, but definitely as weird and unconventional.

- **F**
- [Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183660/?ref_=nm_knf_i1). The visuals and settings are great. Everything else is forgettable, bland and boring.
- [Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123430/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_4). I know that a lot of people enjoyed this movie. I am not one of them.
- [Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123432/). Silly movie with very bad story telling which does not understand its strengths and weaknesses. 
- ⭐️ [Fantastic Mr. Fox](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_16_pd_tp1_cp). One of the best Wes Anderson Movies and in many ways the spiritual predecessor of Isle of Dogs. Would recommend.
- [Flight of the Conchords](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0863046/?ref_=nm_knf_t_4). Two guys from New Zealand stranded in New York. Comedy gold.
- ⭐️ [Fight Club](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). A good movie. If you have not seen it, watch it. Do not wait. It will get spoiled for you.
- [Finest Kind](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7991508/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Very good movie about families and intergenerational conflict. Also stars fishing and drugs. 
- ⭐️ [French Dispatch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8847712/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_3_wr). This movie is basically a love letter to the New Yorkers and its quirky style and people. But, everything is French and has a Wes Anderson touch. I love it. 
- [From Dusk till Dawn](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116367/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_19). A uncut gem. I do enjoy the first part much more than the second. Nevertheless, I do appreciate the movie as a whole.

- **G**
- [Gangs of New York](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). I did enjoy the movie, but it did not leave a lasting impression.
- [Glass Onion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11564570/). The very entertaining successor off the very entertaining Knives Out and as good as it. Glass Onion goes into a very different direction: A intriguing mixture of satire, social commentary crime-comedy and character play. commentary. Benoit Blanc fades a bit into the background. But, the movie is as ingenious the first one. 
- [Gravity Falls](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1865718/?ref_=nm_knf_t_4). One of the best cartoon series I know of.
- [Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6791350/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1_tt_7_nm_0_q_guardians%2520o). I liked the first one, found the second one boring and love the third one. This is a really great end to the series (and for me the last superhero movie I will watch in a long time).

- **H**
- [Hitman's Bodyguard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1959563/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_6). A funny action movie, which is at time annoying and a bit too long.
- [Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8385148/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Basically an over-the-top sequel to "The Hitman's Bodyguard": Little continuity, more crazy jokes and less interesting plot. Good if you like this kind of movie. 
- [Horace and Pete](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5425186/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). This one was much more than I expected. Must watch.

- **I**
- [Inception](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/?ref_=hm_fanfav_tt_15_pd_fp1). This movie gets a tumps up. I don't think it is as smart as everyone claims it is. Yet, Inception is clever and well made.
- [Isle of Dogs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_5). Love the movie. It seems to be made with so much love. It is eye-catching, unique, creative and beautiful. The dogs are great too!

- **J**
- [James Bond: No time to die](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382320/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_6). I this this is a not particularly good movie of a not particularly good franchise. I did like the opening in Italy and some shots are beautiful. However, all in all it feels like a movie that should have been one hour long got a runtime of almost tree!
- [John Wick 1-4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2911666/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Enjoyable mindless action. From the first to thirds the movies get slightly worse, but the 4th manages to be a class of its own (different, but as good as "numero uno"). All of them are visual spectacles with little thought for story. The first is story-wise the best (what ever that means), and the last is the most visual stunning/best choreographed. 
- [Jungle Cruise](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0870154/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_i_1_pd_tp1_cp). Like "Pirates of the Caribbean" this movie about a Disney theme park ride, but it fails to capture the magic of the setting.

- **K**
- [Kate](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7737528/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Another woman-assassin movie. I think the movie is better than it's scores/reviews suggest. If you like this kind of movie, hard action and/or the Japanese setting I would recommend it.
- [Kick-Ass](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/?ref_=nm_knf_i3). One of the better superhero movies.
- [King Arthur: Legend of the Sword](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1972591/?ref_=nm_knf_i1). No. Please no! Nooooo!
- [Kingsman: The Secret Service](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802144/?ref_=nm_knf_i2). A completely over the top action movie. If you can stomach this kind of movie --- which I do --- than its actually great.
- [Knives Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8946378/). Genius crime movie. Overstylized, but in a very good way. 

- **L**
- [The Legend of Drunken Master](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111512/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_drunken%2520master%25202). I think this is one of the last kong fu movies (I know that strictly speaking that is not the right genre, but I do not care) of Jackie Chan. And boy, is it a good movie. I think it is one of the best Jackie Chan movies --- maybe even the best. 
- [Léon: The Professional](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/?ref_=nm_knf_i3). Sometimes I think that the movies in the 90s where so good. Léon is a great example why I often return to this thought. 
- [Logan Lucky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5439796/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). This is one of the best heist movies out there. It has it all: Funny, witty, thoughtful, super satisfying conclusion.  
- [Lucy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2872732/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_6). Eye candy.

- **M**
- [Mad Max: Fury Road](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). A visual spectacle and actually a surprisingly cool premise. One of the best "car-movies" I have seen. 
- [Magic in the Moonlight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2870756/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). I do not like the movie too much. I like all the actors and the ideas are nice --- but I feel like the premise is not my pair of shoes.
- ⭐️[Magnolia](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/?ref_=tt_sims_tti). A set of intricately interwoven stories. Hard to watch, and yet one of my favorite movies. So, i recommend to watch it, but not too often. There are some truly incredible performances to be seen. 
- [The menu](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_the%2520menu). A comedy, horror thriller about fine dining? Yes, and a very good one at that. Super enjoable if you can stomack the violence. Recommendation.  
- ⭐️ [Midnight in Paris](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_10). Great, great, great movie. Easy going, witty, funny, thoughtful but not too ensnared. Lovely setting.
- [Mission Impossible](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_4_tt_7_nm_0_q_mission%2520impossible). This is a very good action movie. It is super well structured, looks gorgeous, and there is always the right amount of tension there. Alas, it gave brid a whole series of not-so-good follow ups. 
- [Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9603212/?ref_=hm_fanfav_tt_t_18_pd_fp1_r). I cannot believe that I am writing this, but this is actually a good action movie. I the almost 3 hours run time I never felt bored. As strange as it sounds, but I am now looking forward to see the next part. 
- [Moon Knight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10234724). The series has a good start, but often gets lost details and boring settings. Overall mediocre.
- [Morbius](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5108870/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Mediocre movie: The setting is interesting, the Marvel tie-ins do not work for me, the ending is lame. 
- [Mortal Kombat, 2021](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293429/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_i_19_pd_tp1_cp). The only thing I managed to like about this movie is the trailer.
- [Murder on the Orient Express](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3402236/?ref_=nm_knf_i4). A good movie with amazing cinematography.

- **N** 
- [Natural Born Killers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632/?ref_=nm_knf_i3). Albeit the script is by Quentin Tarantino this movie has too much Oliver Stone in it for me.
- [Now You See Me](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1670345/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_i_16_pd_tp1_pbr_ic). Making movies about magic/magicians is a great idea. I did not particularly like this one though.
- [Now You See Me 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3110958/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_1). Like the first one, but worse.

- **O**
- [O Brother, Where are Thou?](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190590/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_17_prd). Interesting journey through Southern USA: The songs are great, the pictures are stunning, the ideas are funny.
- [Once Upon a Time in America](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087843/?ref_=nm_knf_i2). This is a great movie. Maybe a bit too long and to slow for today's audience/viewing-customs. But, for me, it will always be a classic.
- [Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7131622/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_i_9_pd_tp1_cp). This one is probably more interesting for people from USA (or LA specifically), who are more familiar with the whole backstory. But, even if you are like me --- and do not know anything about it --- it is still good movie and a lot of fun.
- [Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7985704/). I don't know. I guess I can best describe it as average. I did not like it that much, but also did not not like it that much.

- **P**
- ⭐️ [Paterson](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5247022/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_8). A slow burner. Did not enjoy it much in cinema, but it became one of my favorite movies after watching it multiple times.
- [Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/?ref_=nm_knf_i2).  OK. First and best pirates (actually the only good one).
- [Pulp Fiction](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). This is a great movie. Not my favorite Tarantino, but still very watchable.
- [Puss In Boots: The Last Wish](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3915174/). A life reaffirming animation movie for children that looks amazing --- and goes a complete different direction than a Pixar movie. Here you have it. 

- **R**
- [Red Notice](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1428524/?ref_=ttfc_fc_wr2). A bad heist movie with Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds. I like the genre, but the movie not so.
- [Reservoir Dogs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10763164/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_25). Almost more a play than a movie. Watch it if you like this sort of thing. I love it. 
- [Rifkin's Festival](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8593904/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_3). A Woody Allen movie that plays is San Sebastian and does not want to be more or less than that. 

- **S**
- [See How They Run](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13640696/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_7_nm_1_q_see%2520h). Well made, mellow movie with some ok jokes and an ok plot. I realy wanted to like it more. 
- [Seven Pounds](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814314/?ref_=ttls_li_tt). Kind-off a feel-good movie with Will Smith, but I do not like the premise and the message.
- [Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9376612/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Yet another Marvel movie: Funny at times, some very impressive visuals and a view good ideas; and also, a shallow story, shallow characters and some very dump moments.
- [Sin City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_6). Beautiful eye candy.
- ⭐️ [Spider Man: Across the spider verse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362722/?ref_=hm_fanfav_tt_i_13_pd_fp1_r). One of the best animated movies I know. Definitely must watch if animation and/or the "spider man" theme is not offputting. 
- ⭐️ [Superbad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0829482/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45). One of my favorite comedies. It is perfect for what it is. Michael Cera is Michael Cera. Jonnah Hill is Jonnah Hill. And, Bill Hader steals the show.
- [Succession](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1). One of the best series I ever watched. Season 3 is probably the weakest, but is still better than almost all other TV dramas/comedies.
- [Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236/?ref_=nm_knf_i1). Albeit the movie has all elements that I should like I did not enjoy this one. 
- [Swiss Army Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4034354/?ref_=nm_knf_t_2). Quite good if you can sustain the weirdness. In some sense a parody of many indie movie conventions, but a bit too over the top at times.

- **T**
- ⭐️ [The Big Lebowski](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/). And imensly good way to waste ones time. Probably the best slacker movie and one of the finest of them all.
- ⭐️ [The Boys S1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/episodes?season=1&ref_=tt_eps_sn_1). AMAZING.
- [The Boys S2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/episodes?season=2). Still good. it manages to be more structured than the first season, while being much more all over the place at the same time.  
- [The Boys S3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/episodes?season=3). They go way to deep in this one. Better than season 2, but not as novel as season 1. 
- [The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6905542/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_6). This is an incredible unique and wonderful series. Please watch if you are not taken aback by the style and like fantasy.
- [The Dark Knight](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=e31d89dd-322d-4646-8962-327b42fe94b1&pf_rd_r=DCT5YV01C20Z2HCMK04R&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=15506&pf_rd_i=top&ref_=chttp_tt_4). Very good movie. Maybe a bit overrated? Liked it a lot at first, but wouldn't watch it anymore (which is not a particularly good sign).
- [The Expendables 1, 2 & 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Meh.
- ⭐️ [The Gentlemen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8367814/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). I guess this is Guy Ritchie at its best. Pretty much everything I like about his movies, without much of the bad.
- [The Godfather i, ii & iii](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/?ref_=adv_li_tt) Top. Aged very well. First is best.
- ⭐️ [The Grand Budapest Hotel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2278388/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_4). A gem. And probably, my favorite Wes Anderson movie. The whole movie is polished to the max. The story is touching, intense and comical. The colors are great. The depiction of West Europe is perfect. I love it.
- [The King's Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6856242/). The movie has some beautiful pictures, but overall it felt like a waste of time.
- [The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362270/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1). Wes Anderson at its best. This is just a great, great movie.
- [The Man from U.N.C.L.E.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1638355/?ref_=nm_knf_i4). A good agent movie with the actor from these awful new-age Superman movies. For my personal taste the movie a bit too much of a caricature and a bit too dynamic. But probably that is just me.
- [The Matrix](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). Difficult now to see how influential this movie was. Albeit it did not age that well (partly because of the follow up movies, I think), Matrix is still great for what it was.
- [The Men who stare at Goat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234548/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_t_15_pd_tp1_pbr_ic). The trailer is better than the movie. The latter is rather mediocre. 
- [The Nice Guys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3799694/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_1). This is a great movie that a lot of time draws its comedic elements from reality. Which is great. Also the 70s feeling are just great. 
- [The Old Guard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7556122/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). This movie is definitely not for me. I do not hate it, but I definitely do not like it.
- [The Protégé ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6079772/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Mediocre assassin movie mind candy. Nothing particularly memorably though.
- [The Rock](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/). Action classic. Pretty much defined what I expect from an action movie.
- [The Transporter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). Great action movie which --- in my eyes --- cemented the prototype of a Jason Statham role.
- [The Vault](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9742794/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). Mediocre heist movie with nice pictures.
- ⭐️ [The Worlds End](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1213663/?ref_=ttls_li_tt). I like all the Edgar Wright movies, nit this is the one I enjoyed the most (or baby driver?). It is a great comedy with an absurd stories and some slick cinematography; best enjoyed with some friends, a beer and without knowledge of what to expect.  
- [The Wrestler](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_i_12). Never was a movie about a fucked-up wrestler that gripping --- I also never seen another movie about wrestlers. Still great. 
- [To Rome With Love](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1859650/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_9). Very enjoyable movie, but for me somehow overshadowed by Midnight in Paris.
- [Triangle of Sadness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_q_triangle%2520of). Very enjoyable movie. I heard that many did not like it because it supposedly is an overly cynical take on rich people, but I did like it. 
- [True Romance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108399/?ref_=nm_flmg_wr_24). Fun movie. Easy to watch but nothing amazing.

- **V**
- [Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2239822/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_7_wr). Okaish science fiction movie. Would not recommend, but also not discourage watching it.
- [V for Vendetta](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/?ref_=tt_sims_tt). Matrix without the computers and political instead of transcendental philosophy. One of Natalie Portmans best roles. I can recommend the movie.

- **W**
- [Wednesday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13443470/?ref_=hm_fanfav_tt_t_2_pd_fp1). Mediocre story, but: intriguing setting, good acting, amazing aesthetics.
- [Whatever Works](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1178663/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_16). The movie works for me. One of the better Woody Allen movies. I am not sure about Larry David. It seems that he is not as funny as he normally is. But ok; good movie.
- [Who am I](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3042408/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0). This is a German movie about hackers and its actually good. Fast pasted, nice idea, and well made. I do however think that I will not watch it a second time. So there is that.
- [When Marnie Was There](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398268/?ref_=nm_knf_t_3). One of my favorite Ghibli movies. At points maybe a bit too frumpy.
- [Wolfwalkers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5198068/). The movie is great. It has some pacing problems and the style is almost a bit to loose at some point. But, I still love the art-style. Its so great and unique and expressive and beautiful. I thus think that Wolfwalkers is a must see for everyone who likes animation in some way or another.
- [Wonder Women 1984](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7126948/). Oh god, no. Please stop this already.
- [Wrath of Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11083552/?ref_=hm_tpks_tt_i_3_pd_tp1_cp). One of the worse Guy Richie/Jason Statham Movies. The basic setting and ideas did not convince me. 
 
**Z**
- [Zombieland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/?ref_=nm_knf_i4). A good little zombie movie. 

## 📖 Books
Sometimes I do read:

- *Hammack (2023): The Thing We Make.* This is a great little book that tries to pinpoint the definition of engineering.
- *Lenhard (2019): Calculated Surprises.* There where too many errors in the explanation of Neural Networks so I stoped reading. 
- *Morini (2014): Il rischio.* Italian booklet about risk from a philosophical standpoint. Very interesting. 
- *Kosko (1994): Fuzzy Thinking: The New Science of Fuzzy Logic.* Interesting to see how Kosko saw the role of fuzzy logic during its prime time (maybe a bit later already?). 
- *Kosko (2006): Noise.* This is a very cool book with a quite unique perspective of noise. Easy to read and yet very deep, albeit some aspects are maybe a bit outdated.
- *Contino (2018): Brand by Hand.* Beatyful book. The text-part is so so, but the artworks and the overall design is great. 
- *Snicket (2021): Poison for Breakfast.* Great little meditation about writing.  
- *Briggs (1990): Turbulent Mirror.* One of these 80s-90s book when everyone thought chaos theory is the greatest thing ever. The book is better than I expected. Very enjoyable. I very much liked the mirror metaphor. 
- *Abraham & Shaw (2016): Dynamics.* Great, great book about visualizing dynamical systems. Has many intuitions and (almost) none of the math. Great
- *MDHR (2020): The Art of Cuphead.* If you like the stile this book is perfect. One of the richest art--books I know. 
- *Bradshaw (2017): The Trainable Cat.* Very informative book about cats (and how to train them). Geared towards cat owners, but I others also would find it interesting.
- *Narayanamurti & Tsao (2021): The Genesis of Technoscientific Revolutions - Rethinking the Nature and Nurture of Research.* The book is better than its title. It starts strong but got boring for me quite quickly. The info about Xerox was great, but overall I had the feeling that it was more a series of blog posts than a fully developed book.
- *Bertoloni (2019): Mechanism.* A very interesting book, by an extremely knowledgable author. Even tough I am not particularly interested in medicine (and its history) I still found the exposition compelling. 
- *Abelson (1995): Statistics As Principled Argument.* I wanted to like this book, but I could not. While I agree with the basic idea (i.e, that scientist statistics should use statistics as tools to strengthen their arguments), I disagree with many --- if not most --- of the provides rationales and examples. It is also written in a way that is much to self righteous.  
- ⭐️ *Atkins (2020): Fake Love Letters, Forged Telegrams, and Prison Escape Maps: Designing Graphic Props for Filmmaking.* A joy to read. Has less content about Wes Anderson than I would have thought. It does however manage to build that into an advantage. 
- *Bakan (2005): The Corporation.* A pathological look at corporations. This is a good read.
- *Bishop (2011): Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.* Good for looking things up and getting a first notion of particular topics. Nice plots.
- *Bitmap Books (2019): The Art of Point-and-Click Adventure Games.* A beautiful book. An easy read. A joyful dive into nostalgia. Not very meaty.
- *Bogle (2017): The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.* Had it recommended by a colleague. Not my pair of shoes.
- *Burtynsky (2013): Water.* I have mixed feelings about this one. I think there could be more pictures in there. The accompanying texts could be more refined. Perhaps even poetic. They are not. However, the pictures are breathtaking. The overall concept is great. And, the book is as inspiring as I would have hoped.  
- *Cartwright (2020) Nature, the Artful Modeler.* Very interesting. Assumes some familiarity with the work of Cartwright.
- *Childers (2013) Philosophy and Probability.* Very good book.
- *[Chimero (?) The Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/).* meh.
- *Cleave (2014): Royal London Sketchbook.* I would recommend th is book only for a small niche audience, that are interested in the technique. Which is: Photos post-processed to appear like some form of painting.
- ⭐️ *Contino (2018): Brand by Hand: Blisters, Calluses, and Clients: A Life in Design.* Beatyful design book. Quite uniqure illustrations. Some of the topics could need more exposures. 
- *Diaconis (2017) Ten Great Ideas about Chance.* I like it. Jumps a round a little bit too much and probably assumes to much pre-knowledge on for specific parts. Goes quite deep about some topics.
- *Edney (2019) Cartography: The Ideal and Its History.* Definitely written with cartographers as readers in mind. Nevertheless interesting.
- *Efron & Hastie (2016): Computer Age Statistical Inference.* Very technical, very interesting. Suprisingly good read.
- ⭐️ *Ende (1994) Zettelkasten.* Wow!
- *Ende (1982): Die Schattennähmaschiene.* Eine illustrierte Gedichtssammlung von Michael Ende (Unendliche Geschiche). Sehr lieb gemacht. Die illustrationen fand ich ein wenig zu plakativ.  
- ⭐️ *Ende (1979): Die unendliche Geschichte.* <3 <3 <3
- *Foer (2011) Moonwalking with Einstein.* One of my favorite non-fiction books.
- ⭐️ *Fortrey (2005): The Earth: An Intimate History.* A must read for any earth-scientist. Care if you are not a native speaker since the language is suprisingly sophisticated (very gentle too).
- *Franklin (2001): The Science of Conjecture.* Scholarly tome about conjectures, evidence based decision making and probabilistic reasoning before the calculus of probability was invented. Hard to read, but very rich.
- *Franklin (2009): What Science Knows: And How it Knows it.* Franklin is super smart, but this book is much to opinionated and on the nose for me. Overall it felt like a letdown after reading the "The Science of Conjecture". 
- *Gladwell (2008) Outliers.* Did not age particularly well. I enjoyed it back in the day tough.
- ⭐️ *Goodfellow, Bengio, & Courvile (2016) Deep Learning.* Good book. A bit theoretical, but not too much. Perhaps a bit difficult for the novice. Good to look things up.
- *Jean Jullien (2022): Jean Jullien.* TK
- *Jean Jullien (2016): Modern Life.* A bit on the short side. Yet most pictures are small, self contained parables about modern life. The not-so good illustrations are still imaginative and drawn in a pleasant way.
- ⭐️ *Le Carré (2019) Federball.* <3
- *Klein (2002) No Logo.* A book that became bigger than itself. Actually OK.
- *MacKay (2003): Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms.* Well written and interesting, but a bit to chaotic for my taste. Also I am not particularly interested in many topics.
- *Miyazaki (2005): The Art of Howl's Moving Castle.* A beautiful art-book for a beautiful movie. Text is used only sparingly, but when it is insightful. The quality of the pictures is great. I love the story boards.
- *Moore, Gibbons & Higgins (1987) Watchmen.* I don't like the style, but the story is breathtaking.  
- *Murphy (2012) Machine Learning.* Very good to look things up, but not made for *reading* it cover to cover. Also, over 1k pages! WTF.
- *Page (2018) The Model Thinker.* Very enjoyable.
- ⭐️ *Polan (2018): A Place of My Own.* A very good book if you are interested in architecture and building (as a hobby I guess). Poetic, complex, well-paced. And, exactly the right length for such a book.
- *Priest (2017): Logic: A Very Short Introduction.* Very nice book. I think the different chapters are best enjoyed with some pause between each one (even or maybe even because that will necessitate some backtracking trough the short booklet).  
- *Proctor & Schiebinger (ed, 2008) Proctor, R: Agnotology.* More interesting than I expected, less than I hoped.
- *Otto (2019) Wütendes Wetter.* Auf der Suche nach den Schuldigen für Hitzewellen, Hochwasser und Stürme. German. *Interesting popular science book about the genesis climate attribution studies. Maybe a tidbit too long for the info that is provided*.
- *Samir (2016): Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction.* I liked it very much so. Very short, but well argued. Not sure how much prior knowledge is useful to enjoy the book. 
- *[Singer (2020?) Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).* Probably good if your into this kind of thing. I am not. 
- *Spiegelthaler (2019): The Art of Statistics.* Well written. Explains a lot.
- *Stigler (1990) The History of Statistics.* Great read. Very interesting.
- ⭐️ *Taleb (2007): Fooled by Randomness.* A gem.
- ⭐️ *Taleb (2016): The Bed of Procstes.* My favorite book by Taleb and a great influence on my thinking.
- *Tufte (2006) Beautiful Evidence.* Very good. Inspiring.
- *Vehlmann & Bodart (2005) Green Manor II* Very witty. Fun and easy read.
- *White et al. (1993) Complexity and Chaos.* Not sure what to think about this *thing*. Definitely not my pair of shoes.
- *Ekeland & Étienne (2021): Der Zufall (Die Comic-Bibliothek des Wissens).* Tolle Illustrationen, aber ohne Vorwissen ist der Inhalt zu spartanisch rübergebracht. Manche der Bilder und Beispiele sind gut, aber insgesamt ist alles zu wenig ausgeführt. 
- ⭐️ *Taniguchi (2019): The Walking Man.* This is an amazing comic, or series of comics I guess. Very inspirational. 
- ⭐️ *Cartwright (2022): A Philosopher Looks at Science.* This is a great book. I think it is a good overview of Nancy Cartwrights ideas, albeit maybe not the best book to start. Still, it is very clearly written --- not complicated at all --- and in that sense much easier to read than some of her other books. I also like the illustrations. 
- *Cartwright et al. (2023): The Tangle of Science.*  Its a good book (albeit the print quality is quite bad). For me it is, however, largely superseded by Cartwrights *A Philosopher Looks at Science* 


## 🎬 Regisseurs

## 🧩 Toys
- [Hanayama Cast Trinity](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-trinity/). Difficult, but doable. For me this is right at the limit where these kind puzzles still make fun (a bit more difficult, like the Quartet, and it would become aggregating). 
- [Hanayama Cast Laby](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-laby/). I do not know what a laby is, but the puzzle is nice. It contains two steps I did not expect and is designed in a very cool way. 
- [Hanayama Cast Galaxy](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-galaxy/). I liked this one. It is similar to the [Cast Coil](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-galaxy/), but much less involved (+ there is something else you need to solve it). Tthis puzzle might even be great if you enjoy the kind of solution. 
- [Hanayama Cast Coil](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-coil/). This one is easier than one would think at first. It looks very nice and I can see appreciate its deliberate design. However, I do not particularly enjoy this kind of puzzle. 
- ⭐️ [Hanayama Cast Key II](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-key-ii/). Probably my favourite Hanyama puzzle. It is easy enough so you don't get a headache. But, it also requires enough attention and observation skills to keep you on your toes. It is designed in stages, each one has a new trick to discover. It is a pure delight. 
- [Hanayama Cast L’oeuf](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-loeuf/). Very beatyful puzzle with an extremely satisfying solution. Probably a bit easier than the difficulty would suggest. 
- [Hanayama Cast Box](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-box/). More difficult than you think, but very nice solution. Enjoyed it a lot. 
- [Hanayama Cast Harmony](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-harmony/). Beautiful puzzle with a nice trick. Very enjoyable.
- [Hanayama Cast Coaster](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-coaster/). This is a great puzzle that I do really use as a coiffure.
- [Hanayama Cast Star](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-star/). The puzzle looks better in reality than on the pictures. Feels quite nice. Took me quite long to figure out how it works.
- [Hanayama Cast Nutcase](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-nutcase/). Actually simpler than the level would suggest. Very nice solution.
- [Hanayama Cast News](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-news/). I only was able to solve this one out of pure luck while playing around with it. Took me then still some time to understand its mechanism. Very good puzzle, but quite advanced.
- [Hanayama Cast Quartet](https://hanayama-toys.com/product/cast-quartet/). Perhaps the puzzle that took me the longest so far. I am told that it has multiple solutions. The one i found is enough for me. The solution is quite satisfying. But tricky! Happy to not do it again!  

## 🎪 Youtubes

- [Adam Something](https://www.youtube.com/@AdamSomething). Very opinionated videos about city planning and transportation. I particularly like the way he deconstructs the grandeur of Musk & Co. 
- [Italian Innovators](https://www.youtube.com/@ItalianInnovators/). Very interesting historical lectures about Italian design and innovations. Maybe a bit too biased at points.  
- [Engineerguy](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerguyvideo/videos). Makes you fall in love with engineering (again). 
- 🎭 [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw). For me the best channel about (popular) math.

- [AI Coffee Break with Letitia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCobqgqE4i5Kf7wrxRxhToQA). Perhaps my favorite channel for updates regarding trends in ML.

- [Cinemassacre](https://www.youtube.com/AngryNintendoNerd). Game reviews and some movie stuff. The "angry video game nerd" was great back in the day. The whole channel is not what it one was. That is ok. That is time. The reviews you can find there are very personal and opinionated. Sometimes still funny. I would not probably not recommend the channel, but its definitely something to watch on a rainy day.
- 🎭 [Du Salzane](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBvfIznyE2OVJdMcqfd_aLg). Very interestinf automata.
- [Henry AI Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHB9VepY6kYvZjj0Bgxnpbw). Meh. Ok overviews over Machine Learning topics and papers. I do not appreciate the shorter --- 2-5 minutes --- videos. The longer ones --- 15-30 minutes --- are quite nice however.
- [History of Hydrology Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJvhzZ9wjcEJEnnnHyLoSZQ). Oldtimers talk about hydrology. Some of the interviews are interesting and some boring–but all of them are lengthy.

- 🎭 [Lutèce Créations automatons](https://www.youtube.com/c/LutèceCréationsautomatons/videos). The best channel on classical automata that I know. 
- [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd). I do not particularly like it. Extremely well produced Youtube channel reviewing gadgets and other tech related products. For me it often feels too smooth. Sometimes too uncritical. In general goodish. 
- ⭐️ [Matthewmatosis](https://www.youtube.com/user/Matthewmatosis). Probably the best game-reviewer on Youtube. Thoughtful, in-depth, long, and critical. Also the channel which gave me the idea to frame this note as micro reviews. 
- [OskarPuzzle](https://www.youtube.com/user/OskarPuzzle). A puzzle maker on youtube discusses his puzzles and process. Very fascinating. 
- 🎭 [Peaceful Cuisine](https://www.youtube.com/user/ryoya1983). Slow and beatyful Japanese cooking at home. Very relaxing. 
- ⭐️ [RedLetterMedia](https://www.youtube.com/user/RedLetterMedia). Easily the best reviewers of all things (modern) cinema. Also, very, very funny.
- ⭐️ [Rose Anvil](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCId9g4zlQ9BOn6fLKIt1Y0A). The best channel I found to learn about shoes and leather. Also cool if you want to see a lot of shoes cut in half. 
- [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://www.youtube.com/user/peppermint78). Best science news channel I know. 
- ⭐️ [ScienceOnline](https://www.youtube.com/c/ScienceOnline/videos). For a long time this was my favourite science channel on youtube. Sadly the creator died. May he rest in peace.
- 🎭 [Sinnett Sticks](https://www.youtube.com/user/StinnettStickStudio). Some wood carving/stick making inspiration. I think one has to be in the right mood to enjoy it.  
- [Suff Made Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj1VqrHhDte54oLgPG4xpuQ). Funny DIY engineering projects. Inspirational, but not particularly educational. 
- [Teoh Yi Chie](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeohYiChie). Thoughtful reviews of art-related stuff. Artbooks, papers, pens, digital drawing tools, etc.). Can recommend.
- [Terry Barentsen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHRUAMAzVUS_Szvxn55GXaQ). Amazing biking videos from crazy people.
- ⭐️ [The Art and Making of](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCul0hqYdXADxADyoIku4p5g). Best reviewer of "the art of *xyz* books" and "making of *xyz* books" that I know of. Very opinionated and very thorough.

- ⭐️ [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/c/YannicKilcher). Best presenter of Machine Learning papers. Opinionated and smart. Must watch, there is a lot to learn here.
